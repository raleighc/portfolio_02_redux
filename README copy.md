## Creating This Page

For this project I was provided with design images of how the website should look and used html, css, and boostrap to create to final product.
My main struggle for this page came from class and id organization between local css and boostrap css as well as use of the grid system to layout the page properly.
The responsive design through bootstrap made this page much easier to layout the initial skeleton and make the page more usable across different devices with ease.
HTML was validated using W3C Validation.
